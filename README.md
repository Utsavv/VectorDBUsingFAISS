## Introduction

FAISS is a library developed by Meta's Fundamental AI Research group for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, even those that do not fit in RAM. FAISS is written in C++ with complete wrappers for Python/numpy, and some of its most useful algorithms are implemented on the GPU. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Installation and Setup

Detailed instructions for installing FAISS and configuring your environment are provided in the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).

## Indexing Techniques

Explore various FAISS indexing methods, including `IndexFlatL2`, `IndexIVFFlat`, and `IndexHNSW`, with practical examples in the [Indexing Techniques](docs/indexing_techniques.md) section.

## Similarity Search Implementations

Learn how to perform similarity searches on high-dimensional data, such as images and text embeddings, in the [Similarity Search Implementations](docs/similarity_search.md) section.

## Use Cases

Discover real-world applications of FAISS, including recommendation systems, image retrieval, and natural language processing tasks, in the [Use Cases](docs/use_cases.md) section.

## Best Practices

Find tips for optimizing performance, managing large datasets, and integrating FAISS with other machine learning tools in the [Best Practices](docs/best_practices.md) section.
